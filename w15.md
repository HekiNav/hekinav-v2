# A transit routing system for Helsinki Region Transport.
## Instructions

Home page is WIP, but has the same routing search as the main routing page.
~~Also please set your system timezone to Europe/Helsinki, or times will be broken.~~ (fixed with w15 changes) (all times shown are in helsinki time)

### **Routing**
Search for places (the search includes all of Finland so all points are not navigable to (yet))


Examples: *Kivenlahti, Pasila, Tapanila, Kerava, Hämeenkylä*


w15 additions: UI upgrades, itinerary on map, realtime vehicle position
### **Stops**
You can click on stops (if they arent visible zoom in) on the map to view their departures.


(stops also have upgraded UI and realtime vehicles)
### **Routes**
You can click on routes on the depature board to view them. You can click stops on the route page to go to the deps of that stop.


(upgraded ui and realtime positions here as well)
**Other Week 15 Changes**
- Loads of bug fixes
- A new MQTT Position framework
- Timezones fixes
**Errors**
With the w15 bug fixes the app is way more stable


Most errors are resolved by hard reloading (Ctrl+R) and/or going to the base Routing page.
If an error still persists, please message me on slack (@Hekinav) or open an issue on gh
